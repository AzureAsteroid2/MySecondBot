You light up the room.`If cartoon bluebirds were real, a couple of 'em would be sitting on your shoulders singing right now.`You're like sunshine on a rainy day.`You bring out the best in other people.`Colors seem brighter when you're around.`You always know how to find that silver lining.`Being around you is like a happy little vacation.`You're like a breath of fresh air.`I like your style.`Is that your picture next to "charming" in the dictionary?`I am so proud of you, and I hope you are too!`You're more helpful than you realize.`Our community is better because you're in it.`You should be thanked more often. Thank you.`The people you love are lucky to have you in their lives.`On a scale from 1 to 10, you're an 11.`Everything would be better if more people were like you.
